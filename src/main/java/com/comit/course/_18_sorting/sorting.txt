Sorting Algorithms
******************

A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts the elements of a 
list in particular order (ascending or descending)

1. QuickSort  (Java uses QuickSort)
2. MergeSort
3. BubbleSort
 
Time Complexity
***************

Is a concept that tells us about the efficiency of an algorithm 
when the size of the input is massive.

The time complexity is expressed using Big O Notation

O(n) - Linear
O(nlogn)
O(n^2) - Quadratic
O(1) - Constant
