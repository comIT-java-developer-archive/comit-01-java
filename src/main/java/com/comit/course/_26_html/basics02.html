    <p>Contrary &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
      It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making 
      it over 2000 years old. <strong>Richard McClintock</strong>, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney 
      College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, 
      from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical 
      literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 
      1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of <em>"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"</em> (The Extremes of Good and 
      Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
      very popular during the <b><i>Renaissance.</i></b> The first line of <i>Lorem Ipsum</i>, "Lorem ipsum
      dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
